# MNIST Digit Classification Project with TensorFlow

This project uses the TensorFlow library to train a digit classification model on the MNIST dataset. The model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) built using TensorFlow's Keras API. The project also includes visualisation of metrics using TensorBoard.

The code is designed to be executed in a Google Colab Notebook.
